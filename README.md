# Neural Ordinary Differential Equations
This is a repository of code developed within the framework of a Bachelor's Thesis at the University of Barcelona on Neural Ordinary Differential Equations. It serves as a final degree project for the joint degrees of Mathematics and Computer Science.

As part of the project, this code provides examples and illustrations of how neural ODEs can be used with various purposes. Additionally, it intends to be a bridge between the theoretical results presented in the main text and the practical applications of this kind of model.
